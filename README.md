## What is OSBX
OSBX is a osu! storyboard file generator that is aiming for collaborative and modularity. With osbx you can code your storyboard project using typescript, a pre-processed language compiling into javascript. The back-end generation layer uses NodeJS queue system to generate storyboards in a fast way. OSBX essence is collaboration, and what make it very different (or planning to make it different) is that it will have a package manager included which will help people creating faster with a growing community.
The current state of the project (1.2.0) is at a "stable" build which allows you to create simple storyboards for 1 difficulty on your beatmap. The core plugin of OSBX is still under development and doesn't have any features yet.
